/*why does't it work if I declare the variale as char ad ot as int?
 * this happes ecause ecause y default char hold 1 yte of iformation, and is SIGNED, therefore holds values between -128 and 126, or some numbers aÃ¬near to this two, and therefore if I require the for cycle to stop just when the char variable is >255, the variable will never be, because it will store maximum a value of 128, and if we would require it to store a higher value, this will be reduced modulo 255 and it iwll be summed to -126, and that will be the value stored (wrapping), therefore still under 128, and never 255 or above */
